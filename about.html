          <img src="./img/logo.png" alt="logo">
          <p>Once deciding the team name, my group had an online meeting and shared our preferred names to pick the most appropriate one. One of the members had suggested the name "Proactive" for the group, and as its meaning, the slogan can hold the initiative and play the battle. We are always active with not only teammates but also customers. My team will discuss potential consumers and make a final decision to ensure a successful business transaction. Another name proposed is "Better Together," which implies that working alone will not generate the expected outcomes as when we collaborate and help one another. Furthermore, each teammate would have their own unique skills in various areas, enabling everyone to reach maximum output. Eventually, my team had a slight combination of them called “Proactive Together” to encompass both our group work and collaboration.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, working in a group, each member will understand their role and take responsibility for their parts. We should determine who we are, what we need from the team, and what we contribute to. Therefore, we can achieve the same goals and values equally and transparently.<p>

              <p>RMIT mail: s3891919@rmit.edu.vn</p>
              <p>Welcome to my introduction; my name is Nguyen A Luy, to sound more friendly, I prefer everyone to call me Luy and my student ID is S3891919.  In  any  case,  I recommend you contact  me  through  my  school  email s3891919@rmit.edu.vn because I have always been using it to serve my educational program. At the moment, I am pursuing a future profession in technology by enrolling at RMIT University to study a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. Well, I love many leisure interests, especially, I am most keen on watching movies and do it three times a week. I would prefer to watch films in different languages, mainly English, because of its advantages. The  foremost  reason  for  this  hobby  is  that  I  could  enhance  my  creativity  and imagination because every movie would have a neatly worked-out plot and its actors and actresses with diverse emotions and situations, making viewers reflect on the story behind it.</p>
              <p>Besides, I have always been interested in  being  a  full-stack web developer  who  can  do  both  front-end  and  back-end  parts  of  the  project with amazing designs to control and understand what he creates entirely. However, I am still a freshman at the university, specifically in the second semester with a little experience in this IT field. I  already  had  some  fundamental knowledge  about  Python  and  UI/UX  design  with  some  worthwhile  projects  through  courses  in my  first  semester.  Furthermore, I recently completed  some  online  courses  about  basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via the website FreeCodeCamp.</p>

              <p>RMIT mail: s3904681@rmit.edu.vn</p>
              <p>To begin, let me introduce myself. My full name is Nguyen Minh Thuan and I was born and grew up in Viet Nam. Besides that, if you want to contact me about some problems about my study, you can contact me via my educational email is s3911999@rmit.edu.vn. At the present, I am studying a bachelor's degree in Information Technology(IT) at RMIT University in order to get a great job related to my hobby. One of my hobbies is playing sports, especially soccer every weekend. However, when the Covid pandemic is spreading in VietNam, I often play online games with my friends at home.</p>
              <p>Like I said before in the Assignment 1 and 2, I am really interested in online games, especially some games that are good both in graphics and storyline. Because when I was young, I dreamt that I could create a great game that not only makes users feel interested in playing this but it also contains an imaginative world that I can imagine creatively. Besides that, this semester, I am studying about Python and SQL to know how to code basic programming. Moreover, I often participate in some free online courses about coding on the Internet so I can know more and more about new programming languages. </p>
