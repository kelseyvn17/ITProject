        <h1>GROUP 16</h1>
        <h2>Project Blood Pressure</h2>
        <h2>Monitor Watch</h2>

      <div class = "job">
        <h3>IV.	SKILLS AND JOBS</h3>
        <h2>1.	A person who has experience in medicine</h2>
        <p>Because our product is a blood pressure monitor watch, its primary function is to test and alert consumers to potential health issues. As a result, if we want to offer this product to the clients effectively, we need to have medical experience. This individual, according to us, will handle various issues linked to notification and identification of some users' health concerns correctly by responding to statistics after each testing as soon as possible.Furthermore, this position is critical to our project since the major function of this gadget is to assess what the users' health issues are and to provide remedies to them, such as utilizing medications or traveling to the hospital. For example, in some emergency scenarios, this individual can quickly provide more solutions so that consumers may successfully protect their health. Aside from that, we'd want to improve other features of this device, such as calling a doctor, so that users may explain and demonstrate their health concerns to a doctor one-on-one and obtain valuable health advice.</p>
        <h2>2.	Electrical engineer</h2>
        <p>Another job in our team, an electrical engineer, is, in our opinion, required if we want this project to continue to expand in the future. My team finds it challenging to assemble and organize electronic components since we only have software knowledge and have no idea how to employ electric components to build a finished product. Aside from that, we can locate someone at RMIT who is pursuing an electrical engineering degree. As a result, this role is critical for our project since it will be extremely difficult to build this project and deliver it to the consumers if we only know theory and don't know how to apply it in practice. Furthermore, if this person has a wide range of knowledge with electrical component assembly, it will be more beneficial to us. Because this job necessitates a high level of concentration and patience, it will save a significant amount of time on this project if this individual has sufficient experience building and operating this gadget.</p>
        <h2>3.	Designer</h2>
        <p>Although the major purpose of this gadget is to test and monitor users' health, the design of the product and interface is critical if we want more people to buy it. When customers read evaluations about our product, designing apps might pique their curiosity. Aside from that, the user interface not only makes it simpler for users to utilize some of the features, but it also helps it become a smartwatch that can be used as a decorative item while walking outside. For example, if someone goes online shopping and sees something that catches their eye due to its look, they will click on it to learn more about its features. If they aren't interested in the appearance of our goods, however, it will be tough for them to remain patient when reading evaluations about it.  Besides that, marketing plays an important role in bringing to the users so designing is the necessary thing that we need to invest our time if we want this project to be successful in the future. </p>
        <h2>4.	Biomedical engineer</h2>
        <p>The other position is very important with my team, this is biomedical engineering which helps us solve some problems related to statistics after testing. Because doctors just give advice by basing on statistics, knowledge of biomedical engineering is very important. This device just checks blood pressure and heartbeat by contacting different users. Therefore, getting correct statistics after each testing is very necessary so doctors can give useful advice to the users. Besides that, this position ont only requires knowledge about the medicine to notify the differences of a variety of statistics but it also helps doctors easier basing on receiving correct information from users. Because of the above reasons, biomedical engineering is a position that I really want to have in the future, and can help us develop this project in the future.</p>
