        <h3>Topic</h3>
        <p>In this project, we will collaborate to create an electronic health monitoring device, namely blood pressure monitoring watch and disease diagnosis. Perhaps blood pressure monitors are no stranger to every person in the 21st century, even now almost every family owns these devices for convenient health monitoring. Because of its popularity, the technologies to create this machine are also clearly revealed. Our team simply based on that research combined with our own skills to create a machine with more outstanding features. Realizing that the standard machines in the market are quite cumbersome and manual, we plan to integrate many new technologies into the machine such as websites, AI, chatbots, etc. and release a more perfect version. Our product aims to be compact, luxurious, modern and much easier to use. It will solve disease anxiety for all walks of life.</p>
        <p>As described, this machine has the main function of measuring the user's blood pressure and heart rate and giving a diagnosis of health status. The measuring device will be designed in a compact design that is easy to move like a watch or bracelet. The remarkable point of the project is the patient information storage website which combines the latest chatbot technology to inform the user in the most natural way. In addition to periodic blood pressure information, our website also allows users to declare other background medical information in their records. Then, the system will automatically base on the information obtained combined with medical knowledge to give the most accurate diagnosis. Thanks to automatic AI technology, users do not need to take notes in medical examination books anymore, just log in to their personal account and all medical information, as well as test results, will be notified. In the future, we also plan to develop the ability to automatically make diagnoses based on facial expression, voice, and blood. The whole process is equivalent to a general check-up in a hospital, but can be replaced by machines and home testing. This is a difficult and ambitious project, but with existing technologies and external assistants, we believe it can be accomplished.<p>

      <div class="Motivation">
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>During the Covid-19 situation in Vietnam and around the world, people are restricted from going out if they do not have the necessary reasons. It can be said that health is one of the priorities in this period because people need to take care of their health to live well. Blood pressure is one of the health issues that might be the leading cause of death in many circumstances. Moreover, doctors advise that citizens should go to the hospital on a regular basis for checkups because of a good health condition. Therefore, from the two points above, our project may bring many benefits for public health. Most importantly, this project will apply AI technology into our website to temporarily diagnose before the user can be able to meet direct doctors. AI is now becoming mainstream with many potential capacities. So, if our team successfully applies AI to this project, it will be helpful and convenient for not only patients but also doctors. Because we allow the system to print the user's health report and give it to doctors, it may lead the treatment process not too long.</p>
        <p>If our members implement this project, we will be able to work with A.I and get it as an experience. Nowadays, most companies are seriously interested in artificial intelligence, so, there are many opportunities for finding jobs in the future. Furthermore, this project combines hardware and websites, so we will know how to create and work smoothly with two of the systems.<p>

  <h3>Landscape</h3>
    <p>With a normal blood pressure monitor, there are hundreds of different types of devices on the market with all kinds of designs and features. However, the technology industry is still in the developing stage in Vietnam and such machines are not yet universally available to everyone. Therefore, the demand for a more modern measuring device is still increasing strongly. The leading companies in this equipment include Omron, Microlife, and Beurer. They are long-established companies with many certifications for the quality and effectiveness of their products that are trusted by many people. They are truly formidable competitors in the market. Nevertheless, our products still have outstanding differences that we believe many people will prefer. Firstly, in terms of design, the project is designed according to the "smaller, more modern" trend that will bring elegance and novelty. This design helps users to move the product easily (carry it with you) so it is convenient to check your health anywhere, anytime. The second is about the feature, as summarized above the device is linked to a health-tracking website which makes it even more beneficial. In fact, many people know about a blood pressure monitor, know how to use it, but do not know how to analyze the results and make a diagnosis because this requires background medical knowledge. Therefore, our product with the ability to inform the diagnosis to the user's ears, will probably be more popular.</p>
    <h2>Aims</h2>
    <h3>Specific Goals</h3>
    <p>One beneficial goal is to save time so that users, especially the elderly, just have to spend a few minutes every day to check their blood pressure. Furthermore, in some emergency cases, they just require a short period of time to wait for the final outcome. As a result, it not only saves consumers time while evaluating their health, but it also allows them to quickly safeguard their health at home on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>Second, this gadget will declare the state of users' health depending on the statistics collected after testing. Furthermore, if users have health concerns, it will provide some suggestions and methods that they may utilize to successfully identify and prevent sickness. Furthermore, it will provide them with up-to-date information on appropriate diet that they may follow on a daily basis as well as some exercise that they can do in their spare time to enhance their health. As a result, if these illnesses can be managed at home by relaxing and taking medications, it may provide some therapy. If they are serious, however, this device will have some options, such as notifying their family and urging them to go to the hospital for a careful examination.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, if a user uses this gadget, they will be given a personal account where they may verify and save data after each test. This account not only allows users to quickly and conveniently check their health, but it also stores and updates data for a long period. As a consequence, users or physicians may quickly review prior findings to determine the state of a user's ailment. Because high blood pressure, a dangerous condition that affects the old, can affect the young if they don't take care of their health now. As a consequence, doctors may depend on prior results to effectively treat these disorders in the future for their patients.</p>
    <h3>Smaller Goals</h3>
    <p>When it comes to testing and providing appropriate findings, this gadget will be adaptable. If the risk of disease is low, for example, this gadget will provide some options for consumers to use at home. However, if illnesses pose a significant threat to users' health, it will assist them in contacting a doctor if they so want. As a consequence, the doctor may depend on the results to provide them advice on how to treat and maintain their health at home without having to go to the hospital right away.</p>
    <p>People cannot travel somewhere to check their health on a regular basis, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, this device will be a vital piece of equipment for every household, particularly those with senior members. It is not only used to let users check their health fast and effectively at home, but it is also used to test the health of patients in hospitals and medical clinics all over the world.</p>
    <h2>Plan and Progress</h2>
    <p>We have discussed each other in the first meeting about each member’s idea, then choosing the best impression. We have four ideas which are a convert music application, two different games, and one medical machine. In which, the only thing we have in common is developing a website. Thanh Nguyen gave our team an opinion different from others that is a combination between the medical and IT industry. She told us that it is inspired from the sphygmomanometer at her home, and her family often uses it to check blood pressure. In particular, people cannot go outside during this period because of Covid-19 situation in Vietnam. Therefore, if we connect that device with technology, it may mostly lead humans to essentially have some sort of good healthcare, which generally is quite significant. Originally, she wanted to make a tablet which links to cuffs by rubber tubing. To begin measuring blood pressure, a person must first take action with the gadget. Next, they will be using the device to scan QR code on the web page once they have the three indicators of systolic, diastolic, and pulse. The personal profile details in the Health Care system will be immediately updated. Because somebody examines their health on a regular basis, they will not be concerned about illnesses. Furthermore, once they scan, they will be driven to regulate their pulse rate by a healthy diet, regular exercise, and proper medication use. Then they'll go to the website and look at their information. On the web, we have two choices: employ A.I. technology to recognize the person's facial expression through a webcam, or engage with our chatbot by asking a few simple questions to predict the user's condition. During our discussion, we recognized that AI technologies will be applied in this project. According to our knowledge, machine learning is one of the topics inside AI. These days, machine learning tends to optimize devices to create smaller ones. Therefore, we researched and found a smartwatch. It is smaller than a tablet, more convenient and fashionable. In short, we decided to create a smartwatch which monitors the user's health and a website. Those are exactly what we are going to do before we begin developing and analyzing our project.</p>
    <p>Due to the situation of Covid-19 in Vietnam, we have to work and study from home, so our meetings are occured online. One suggestion is making a meeting schedule which should follow during the project. We often meet online twice a week through some communication tools such as Facebook Messenger or Discord. Moreover, the places we can share our participation like report, coding and design are Google Docs, Canva and GitHub. After we determine the tools which are used to engage in our project, we deploy the idea and start with a first step of plan. It is a research stage. Obviously, we are studying Information Technology, thus nobody in our team can clarify medical knowledge. We have to research some information relating to the medical industry, especially blood pressure and traditional medicine. Not only reading online articles and books, but also asking friends who are studying and working in this industry are two ways that we carried out in the research stage. Most importantly, we have asked a person who is working and studying in medicine, especially the traditional medicine. They are researching and checking up patients that depends on ying yang methods and five elements. It is known-for methods in some Asean countries, especially in China, because it came from Chinese and seperated from the modern medicine today.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the monitor watch, it is an advanced version from the tablet in old plan. We recognize that it is smaller and more convenient than the old one. Obviously, the smartwatch use the technique which is heart rate and blood pressure sensor. People usually hear abput heart rate sensor, but we believe the blood pressure is not famous much. According to a researching from Michigan State University and Maryland university, the operation way of this sensor is simple. It just need to measure an amount of blood by using optical tools and a probe to discover the alternative pressure.</p>
    <p>About the website development, we created a medicine web fitting with our application named “Blood Pressure Watch”, which was also implemented with the chatterbot to increase the users’ experience. Generally, it has the same functions as every other chatbot such as conducting online conversations with users, acting as a virtual assistant, executing autonomous tasks, and so forth. Therefore, we have to guarantee to follow the exact steps to create the suitable chatbot for our medical website. First of all, we have to define the goals for our bot which is related to healthcare issues and medicine, as it will automate customer support with FAQs and deliver hybrid support as the bot will handle simple queries and transfer the complex ones to the live hospitals. Additionally, it will collect customer feedback to understand their satisfaction level and improve customer experience. Secondly, we would customize the bot profile to deeper understand the objectives and make it more interactive and user-friendly with plenty of choices from the customers. Then, the conversation flow would be implemented in our chatterbot, actually through actions and nodes from users, as each action, we might add different elements as described to drive our conversations forward in a pre-defined manner. The following step is that implement the bot with sentiment analysis. This key chatbot feature can help a lot in analyzing customer data by mining thoughts, opinions, or sentiments. In addition, bots powered with sentiment analysis features can decode the mood of the customer by sentence structures and verbal cues. What’s more, bots can leverage this feature to successfully modify responses as per customer’s emotions. Next, we would define the fallback scenario, simply because bots will never be understanding human queries. There will always be situations when our bot is not capable of fulfilling the user requests and fails to answer a random request. So, we need to prepare the bot for such cases where they cannot recognize the user’s input properly. For that reason, defining the fallback scenarios is a vital part of creating chatbots. Fallback interaction is a default response that pops up when the bot does not comprehend the user message. Finally, when the bot is ready, we expect it to handle queries in an efficient manner. For that to happen, we need to train the bot with the view to sharpen its ability in terms of better communication with users. To be precise, we would export training data in bulk in excel format or we can also edit the training data in the excel file and import it back to update for better performance of the bot.</p>
    <p>Our method for working on this bot is to break it into 3 stages: developing, analyzing, and constructing. Everyone is working on various aspects of the chatbot, but they will all be involved in the development process. Luy is in charge of everything from research to drafting first concepts to understanding about the chatbot construction process, which requires a team effort to finish. Quang Thang is responsible for the chatbot's development; Luy conducted market research to gather data on users' behaviors and latest innovations for the chatbot's advances, then Yen Thanh and Thuan designed the chatbot's UI and symbol.</p>
    <p>The entire team was initially interested in the application of AI and natural language processing and chatterbot, so we had already planned to utilize the chatbot to assist users on our ideal website. Another issue that was addressed related to privacy difficulties, since many websites do not need much of an identity or passwords, which may lead to a massive loss of customer information, so we chose to force all users to sign and log in. To begin, they must create personal accounts with usernames, passwords, phone numbers, and other information to improve the security process.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the monitor watch, it is an advanced version from the tablet in old plan. We recognize that it is smaller and more convenient than the old one. Obviously, the smartwatch use the technique which is heart rate and blood pressure sensor. People usually hear abput heart rate sensor, but we believe the blood pressure is not famous much. According to a researching from Michigan State University and Maryland university, the operation way of this sensor is simple. It just need to measure an amount of blood by using optical tools and a probe to discover the alternative pressure.</p>
    <p>To be more explicit, the first step was to construct a basic UI design with Bootstrap 4.4, from which we could build plenty of other elements. Then, in order to boost user interaction, we would utilize JavaScript to build capabilities for both the website and the connection chatbot. Socket.io will be utilized to guarantee that the frontend and backend can communicate with one another smoothly. We have kept using JavaScript to attach our bot to a certain code so that current customers may interact with it. Furthermore, regular expressions were used to improve the chatbot's answer to user inquiries. Furthermore, because the IT sector is always evolving to suit user expectations, we will continue to investigate and gather information about user activities and psychological thoughts, such as automatically updating innovations and emerging phrases for our chatbot. Finally, our team has the finished product and has successfully built the fundamental computer code that will allow the chatterbot to interact with the user. We have also employed regular expressions to enhance the chatbot intelligence when it comes to responding to users' difficult topics. If we can figure out how it was done, we'll be able to learn more on how to create this chatbot more advanced utilizing AI and machine learning.</p>
