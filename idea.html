    <h1>GROUP 16</h1>
    <h2>Project Blood Pressure</h2>
    <h2>Monitor Watch</h2>
  </div>
  
  <section id="idea">
  <div class="topic">
    <h3>Topic</h3>
    <p>In this project, we will collaborate to create an electronic health monitoring device, namely blood pressure monitoring watch and disease diagnosis. Perhaps blood pressure monitors are no stranger to every person in the 21st century, even now almost every family owns these devices for convenient health monitoring. Because of its popularity, the technologies to create this machine are also clearly revealed. Our team simply based on that research combined with our own skills to create a machine with more outstanding features. Realizing that the standard machines in the market are quite cumbersome and manual, we plan to integrate many new technologies into the machine such as websites, AI, chatbots, etc. and release a more perfect version. Our product aims to be compact, luxurious, modern and much easier to use. It will solve disease anxiety for all walks of life.</p>
    <p>As described, this machine has the main function of measuring the user's blood pressure and heart rate and giving a diagnosis of health status. The measuring device will be designed in a compact design that is easy to move like a watch or bracelet. The remarkable point of the project is the patient information storage website which combines the latest chatbot technology to inform the user in the most natural way. In addition to periodic blood pressure information, our website also allows users to declare other background medical information in their records. Then, the system will automatically base on the information obtained combined with medical knowledge to give the most accurate diagnosis. Thanks to automatic AI technology, users do not need to take notes in medical examination books anymore, just log in to their personal account and all medical information, as well as test results, will be notified. In the future, we also plan to develop the ability to automatically make diagnoses based on facial expression, voice, and blood. The whole process is equivalent to a general check-up in a hospital, but can be replaced by machines and home testing. This is a difficult and ambitious project, but with existing technologies and external assistants, we believe it can be accomplished.<p>

  <div class="motivation">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>During the Covid-19 situation in Vietnam and around the world, people are restricted from going out if they do not have the necessary reasons. It can be said that health is one of the priorities in this period because people need to take care of their health to live well. Blood pressure is one of the health issues that might be the leading cause of death in many circumstances. Moreover, doctors advise that citizens should go to the hospital on a regular basis for checkups because of a good health condition. Therefore, from the two points above, our project may bring many benefits for public health. Most importantly, this project will apply AI technology into our website to temporarily diagnose before the user can be able to meet direct doctors. AI is now becoming mainstream with many potential capacities. So, if our team successfully applies AI to this project, it will be helpful and convenient for not only patients but also doctors. Because we allow the system to print the user's health report and give it to doctors, it may lead the treatment process not too long.</p>
    <p>If our members implement this project, we will be able to work with A.I and get it as an experience. Nowadays, most companies are seriously interested in artificial intelligence, so, there are many opportunities for finding jobs in the future. Furthermore, this project combines hardware and websites, so we will know how to create and work smoothly with two of the systems.<p>

  <div class="landscape">
    <h3>Landscape</h3>
    <p>With a normal blood pressure monitor, there are hundreds of different types of devices on the market with all kinds of designs and features. However, the technology industry is still in the developing stage in Vietnam and such machines are not yet universally available to everyone. Therefore, the demand for a more modern measuring device is still increasing strongly. The leading companies in this equipment include Omron, Microlife, and Beurer. They are long-established companies with many certifications for the quality and effectiveness of their products that are trusted by many people. They are truly formidable competitors in the market. Nevertheless, our products still have outstanding differences that we believe many people will prefer. Firstly, in terms of design, the project is designed according to the "smaller, more modern" trend that will bring elegance and novelty. This design helps users to move the product easily (carry it with you) so it is convenient to check your health anywhere, anytime. The second is about the feature, as summarized above the device is linked to a health-tracking website which makes it even more beneficial. In fact, many people know about a blood pressure monitor, know how to use it, but do not know how to analyze the results and make a diagnosis because this requires background medical knowledge. Therefore, our product with the ability to inform the diagnosis to the user's ears, will probably be more popular.</p>
    <h3>Aims</h3>
    <h4>Specific Goals<h4>
    <p>One beneficial goal is to save time so that users, especially the elderly, just have to spend a few minutes every day to check their blood pressure. Furthermore, in some emergency cases, they just require a short period of time to wait for the final outcome. As a result, it not only saves consumers time while evaluating their health, but it also allows them to quickly safeguard their health at home on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>Second, this gadget will declare the state of users' health depending on the statistics collected after testing. Furthermore, if users have health concerns, it will provide some suggestions and methods that they may utilize to successfully identify and prevent sickness. Furthermore, it will provide them with up-to-date information on appropriate diet that they may follow on a daily basis as well as some exercise that they can do in their spare time to enhance their health. As a result, if these illnesses can be managed at home by relaxing and taking medications, it may provide some therapy. If they are serious, however, this device will have some options, such as notifying their family and urging them to go to the hospital for a careful examination.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, if a user uses this gadget, they will be given a personal account where they may verify and save data after each test. This account not only allows users to quickly and conveniently check their health, but it also stores and updates data for a long period. As a consequence, users or physicians may quickly review prior findings to determine the state of a user's ailment. Because high blood pressure, a dangerous condition that affects the old, can affect the young if they don't take care of their health now. As a consequence, doctors may depend on prior results to effectively treat these disorders in the future for their patients.</p>
    <p>Smaller Goals</p>
    <p>When it comes to testing and providing appropriate findings, this gadget will be adaptable. If the risk of disease is low, for example, this gadget will provide some options for consumers to use at home. However, if illnesses pose a significant threat to users' health, it will assist them in contacting a doctor if they so want. As a consequence, the doctor may depend on the results to provide them advice on how to treat and maintain their health at home without having to go to the hospital right away.</p>
    <p>People cannot travel somewhere to check their health on a regular basis, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, this device will be a vital piece of equipment for every household, particularly those with senior members. It is not only used to let users check their health fast and effectively at home, but it is also used to test the health of patients in hospitals and medical clinics all over the world.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="plan">
    <h3>Plan and Progress</h3>
    <p>We have discussed each other in the first meeting about each member’s idea, then choosing the best impression. We have four ideas which are a convert music application, two different games, and one medical machine. In which, the only thing we have in common is developing a website. Thanh Nguyen gave our team an opinion different from others that is a combination between the medical and IT industry. She told us that it is inspired from the sphygmomanometer at her home, and her family often uses it to check blood pressure. In particular, people cannot go outside during this period because of Covid-19 situation in Vietnam. Therefore, if we connect that device with technology, it may mostly lead humans to essentially have some sort of good healthcare, which generally is quite significant. Originally, she wanted to make a tablet which links to cuffs by rubber tubing. To begin measuring blood pressure, a person must first take action with the gadget. Next, they will be using the device to scan QR code on the web page once they have the three indicators of systolic, diastolic, and pulse. The personal profile details in the Health Care system will be immediately updated. Because somebody examines their health on a regular basis, they will not be concerned about illnesses. Furthermore, once they scan, they will be driven to regulate their pulse rate by a healthy diet, regular exercise, and proper medication use. Then they'll go to the website and look at their information. On the web, we have two choices: employ A.I. technology to recognize the person's facial expression through a webcam, or engage with our chatbot by asking a few simple questions to predict the user's condition. During our discussion, we recognized that AI technologies will be applied in this project. According to our knowledge, machine learning is one of the topics inside AI. These days, machine learning tends to optimize devices to create smaller ones. Therefore, we researched and found a smartwatch. It is smaller than a tablet, more convenient and fashionable. In short, we decided to create a smartwatch which monitors the user's health and a website. Those are exactly what we are going to do before we begin developing and analyzing our project.</p>
    <p>Due to the situation of Covid-19 in Vietnam, we have to work and study from home, so our meetings are occured online. One suggestion is making a meeting schedule which should follow during the project. We often meet online twice a week through some communication tools such as Facebook Messenger or Discord. Moreover, the places we can share our participation like report, coding and design are Google Docs, Canva and GitHub. After we determine the tools which are used to engage in our project, we deploy the idea and start with a first step of plan. It is a research stage. Obviously, we are studying Information Technology, thus nobody in our team can clarify medical knowledge. We have to research some information relating to the medical industry, especially blood pressure and traditional medicine. Not only reading online articles and books, but also asking friends who are studying and working in this industry are two ways that we carried out in the research stage. Most importantly, we have asked a person who is working and studying in medicine, especially the traditional medicine. They are researching and checking up patients that depends on ying yang methods and five elements. It is known-for methods in some Asean countries, especially in China, because it came from Chinese and seperated from the modern medicine today.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the monitor watch, it is an advanced version from the tablet in old plan. We recognize that it is smaller and more convenient than the old one. Obviously, the smartwatch use the technique which is heart rate and blood pressure sensor. People usually hear abput heart rate sensor, but we believe the blood pressure is not famous much. According to a researching from Michigan State University and Maryland university, the operation way of this sensor is simple. It just need to measure an amount of blood by using optical tools and a probe to discover the alternative pressure.</p>
    <p>About the website development, we created a medicine web fitting with our application named “Blood Pressure Watch”, which was also implemented with the chatterbot to increase the users’ experience. Generally, it has the same functions as every other chatbot such as conducting online conversations with users, acting as a virtual assistant, executing autonomous tasks, and so forth. Therefore, we have to guarantee to follow the exact steps to create the suitable chatbot for our medical website. First of all, we have to define the goals for our bot which is related to healthcare issues and medicine, as it will automate customer support with FAQs and deliver hybrid support as the bot will handle simple queries and transfer the complex ones to the live hospitals. Additionally, it will collect customer feedback to understand their satisfaction level and improve customer experience. Secondly, we would customize the bot profile to deeper understand the objectives and make it more interactive and user-friendly with plenty of choices from the customers. Then, the conversation flow would be implemented in our chatterbot, actually through actions and nodes from users, as each action, we might add different elements as described to drive our conversations forward in a pre-defined manner. The following step is that implement the bot with sentiment analysis. This key chatbot feature can help a lot in analyzing customer data by mining thoughts, opinions, or sentiments. In addition, bots powered with sentiment analysis features can decode the mood of the customer by sentence structures and verbal cues. What’s more, bots can leverage this feature to successfully modify responses as per customer’s emotions. Next, we would define the fallback scenario, simply because bots will never be understanding human queries. There will always be situations when our bot is not capable of fulfilling the user requests and fails to answer a random request. So, we need to prepare the bot for such cases where they cannot recognize the user’s input properly. For that reason, defining the fallback scenarios is a vital part of creating chatbots. Fallback interaction is a default response that pops up when the bot does not comprehend the user message. Finally, when the bot is ready, we expect it to handle queries in an efficient manner. For that to happen, we need to train the bot with the view to sharpen its ability in terms of better communication with users. To be precise, we would export training data in bulk in excel format or we can also edit the training data in the excel file and import it back to update for better performance of the bot.</p>
    <p>Our method for working on this bot is to break it into 3 stages: developing, analyzing, and constructing. Everyone is working on various aspects of the chatbot, but they will all be involved in the development process. Luy is in charge of everything from research to drafting first concepts to understanding about the chatbot construction process, which requires a team effort to finish. Quang Thang is responsible for the chatbot's development; Luy conducted market research to gather data on users' behaviors and latest innovations for the chatbot's advances, then Yen Thanh and Thuan designed the chatbot's UI and symbol.</p>
    <p>The entire team was initially interested in the application of AI and natural language processing and chatterbot, so we had already planned to utilize the chatbot to assist users on our ideal website. Another issue that was addressed related to privacy difficulties, since many websites do not need much of an identity or passwords, which may lead to a massive loss of customer information, so we chose to force all users to sign and log in. To begin, they must create personal accounts with usernames, passwords, phone numbers, and other information to improve the security process.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the monitor watch, it is an advanced version from the tablet in old plan. We recognize that it is smaller and more convenient than the old one. Obviously, the smartwatch use the technique which is heart rate and blood pressure sensor. People usually hear abput heart rate sensor, but we believe the blood pressure is not famous much. According to a researching from Michigan State University and Maryland university, the operation way of this sensor is simple. It just need to measure an amount of blood by using optical tools and a probe to discover the alternative pressure.</p>
    <p>To be more explicit, the first step was to construct a basic UI design with Bootstrap 4.4, from which we could build plenty of other elements. Then, in order to boost user interaction, we would utilize JavaScript to build capabilities for both the website and the connection chatbot. Socket.io will be utilized to guarantee that the frontend and backend can communicate with one another smoothly. We have kept using JavaScript to attach our bot to a certain code so that current customers may interact with it. Furthermore, regular expressions were used to improve the chatbot's answer to user inquiries. Furthermore, because the IT sector is always evolving to suit user expectations, we will continue to investigate and gather information about user activities and psychological thoughts, such as automatically updating innovations and emerging phrases for our chatbot. Finally, our team has the finished product and has successfully built the fundamental computer code that will allow the chatterbot to interact with the user. We have also employed regular expressions to enhance the chatbot intelligence when it comes to responding to users' difficult topics. If we can figure out how it was done, we'll be able to learn more on how to create this chatbot more advanced utilizing AI and machine learning.</p>

  <div class="roles">
    <h3>Roles</h3>
    <p>In order to reflect on every individual’s accomplishment and achievements, we had to made clear positions for one another in this assignment, relying on our interests and desired career plan. As Yen Thanh mentioned in her assignment 2, she had a great job in creating a well-designed website so she would be the main technical designer and lead developer in our group. Besides, she would suit the leader position, according to her personality test since she has all the leadership and caring qualities in the team. Then, Quang Thang, who are supposed to be the main developer in our group to create and maintain the application, has a strong experience in using programming languages such as Python or Java. Moreover, he would help us to find the most appropriate tools so as that we can easily approach to coding and designing with technologies our desired system. With a good foundation in coding and constructing the website, Thuan would be responsible for the tester position in the development of our healthcare device and he also analyses and provides some valuable feedback of what should be potential for users, what should be improved etc. Furthermore, he mainly contributed in the UI design for the application since he had a good understanding about UI/UX design theories and his ability of technical designing. Finally, Luy who has a strong knowledge of content checking and arranging the timetable will be the schedule creator in our group; therefore, we can have a clear plan of meetings and communication together. In addition, he also has basic skills in coding and UI experience as he had learned in his first semester, so he would be in charge of developing and technical designing assistant who can help and give some suggestions to the final products. Actually, there are no conflicts among members since everyone has their specific work and positions in the project to perform.</p>
    <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
    <p>We definitely state that our project was developed thoroughly and focused on the top prior features to implement in the application and website first because we only had a very restricted time on accomplishing both software and hardware parts. After all, we reached the final stage and released our completed blood pressure monitor watch and the responsive web page for users and virtual medical assistants. On the other hand, there have been many features that we could not cover since the time available and our abilities have its own limit, specifically, the cybersecurity and privacy and cloud computing were not referred in our IT project. So far, we know that these two areas play an important role in enhancing the system and website aspects, while the cybersecurity could prevent us from the malicious code or hacking issues, the cloud computing help us back-up and restore the important data and increase the high speed of the app. In general, we guarantee to include important milestones and main features that we went through as our scope is to make a monitor watch and an interactive medical site to satisfy the user’s needs and the convenience of remote health examination. First the healthcare watch primarily activate to estimate some important indexes indicating on the screen for users to see what kind of health status, then these number would be saved and transmitting to the website fitting with their signing accounts so that the bots and doctors could generate the health results for them. For the website, the users have to enter the exact username and password to log in their personal health account to receive the doctor responses. Moreover, they can join in the live chat room with bot or online doctors by entering some generated code of their desired room.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="tech">
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>As our group project is to create a digital device associated with the healthcare and medical sector, which might help people check up and observe their health status themselves, so we need some softwares, hardwares and tools embracing the system. To be specific, in order to make a blood pressure monitor like a digital sphygmomanometer, it is required to have some hardwares including good controller boards, sensor, battery power, which would be applied some algorithms, most likely Oscillometric methods such as estimation and detection (Severe Hypertension Network 22nd 2007). In fact, every algorithm in the device would be thoroughly calculated and written in the exact functions in coding to give out the most accurate prediction for users as well as patients due to its medical sensitivity.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we also need some softwares to connect with the given hardwares to output and save important data about the user's health status. Specifically, AFib – BPM GUI is used to monitor blood pressure for Windows and Apple interfaces. There are some menu tools will be activated after connecting to our device including measurement, mode, pressurize and leak buttons.</p>
    <p>After combining both softwares and hardwares together, we got the whole new product like the smart watch in the picture below.</p>
    <p>We divide two parts, in which, one shows personal information, and another will display three indexes such as SYS, DIA, and PUL. After completely measuring, the user will own an individual QR code which is scanned to access the Health Care system.</p>
    <p>Finally, as we aims at examine and give professional opinions about health problems remotely, specifically in such Covid-19 pandemic, so that we need to make an active website to interact with virtual doctors, nurses or medical practitioners to get some precious advices about their current health results which has been estimated in the blood pressure monitor watch. We did use certain 3rd technologies to make the development process easier and faster. We used Bootstrap 4.4 to create the UI for the frontend application, and Javascript to make the web accessible. Because our program required it to react to user requests, we picked Node.js to build the backend server. Socket.io is utilized to link the two frontend and backend operations, helping the process go more smoothly.</p>
    <p>Since the artificial intelligence development, we aim at applying it to our project, explicitly the facial recognition features in the digital sphygmomanometer device. Face recognition software tries to recognize a person relying on their distinctive facial features and skin texture. The program then compares it to the database for a number of matches. The technique is simple and requires only a camera-equipped gadget. As face recognition has infiltrated nearly every aspect of healthcare, the diagnosis procedure will be no exception. The fundamental notion is that we are getting close to a stage when telemedicine can bring treatment directly to our homes. The user's health condition is only a facial scan away with face recognition applications. A person may monitor their heart rate, blood pressure, pressure level, and more by just facing the camera.</p>
    <p>Computer-aided diagnostics (CAD) is becoming more widespread in the medical field. In the diagnosing process, using a tailored photo recognition system, particularly, helps to decrease errors. Machine learning-based approaches can be used by doctors to spot abnormalities in visual information and help accelerate therapy. Furthermore, integrating computer vision with diagnostic abilities might help clinicians get better results. For example, they can find and track joint angles and velocities. It helps patients have a better response to therapy and recover faster.</p>
    <p>The second IT technology that we would love to cover in our website is chatterbot and natural language processing. The major goal of incorporating chatbot into the website is to give the highest level of assistance to users and doctors. Unlike traditional assistance, however, this software uses machine learning techniques to infuse the site with the human logical thinking necessary to function properly. Furthermore, while human assistance is insufficient for today's generations, AI-powered chatbots give 24/7 customer service, quick replies, and lower operational expenses. Since we are new to the programming language and cannot construct the whole perfect chatbot; therefore, to make the process of developing it easier, we decided to utilize the other source codes available on the Internet. In detail, with REVE Chat's ready-to-use chatbot platform, establishing a bot for a web page may be uncomplicated. It enables us to create bespoke bots with no coding in order to meet our company demands. More critically, we can easily launch bots, teach them, and track their performance. To install the chatterbot created using REVE builder, we just reused the brief source code onto our web.</p>
    <p>Because most of us are still unfamiliar with programming, we ran into issues at first, particularly when setting up the tools and technologies to ensure that both the frontend and backend are ready to communicate. Fortunately, by following the instructions in the documentation, we were able to resolve the issues. Since Yen Thanh and Quang Thang have more coding knowledge, they can choose the best tools for the group to own and instruct the others to learn a little coding so that the preferred technologies can be implemented into the app.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="test">
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>The great success of a product is the result of a series of successes in each ingredient process. Perhaps the process of shaping and building the product is considered the most important in a project. However, the results of the product testing process are what determines whether a product will be successful, whether it will gain popularity in the market, or just a flash of an idea. Therefore, our team attaches great importance to the product inspection stage. Certainly, we are not going to wait until the product is finished to test it because that is too risky and unprofessional. However, since this is an IoT (Internet of Things) product that requires both hardware and software, creating a prototype or mockup is quite time-consuming and complicated. As a result, we have decided to conduct a test throughout the operation, meaning that every time a certain function is completed (such as blood pressure measurement, website, or interface) the inspection process will be proceeded and then repaired. Once we get the expected results, we move on to the next phase. However, the question is how do we test them? All members have discussed and agreed that the test will be based on 3 criteria: efficiency, accuracy and consistency, and user experience.</p>
    <p>Efficiency testing process: in this part, we will test the product on several people (minimum 5 people) with different medical conditions and blood pressure to see if the device is working properly. The experimenters will be volunteers of all ages and regardless of qualifications. After that, we will collect data on time, number of defects, speed, etc. and conduct analysis and re-edit the product.</p>
    <p>Accuracy and consistency testing: In this section, we will use a combination of external tools to compare the results obtained from our project to improve accuracy and add outstanding features (what makes our products special in the market).</p>
    <p>UI/UX testing: Since our product is a health monitoring device, it should be usable by all walks of life. Therefore, for the best results, we will let a group of people (minimum 5 people) with different backgrounds (tech-savvy, novice, baby boomer generation, millennials, etc.) use the product and gather their feedback about the user interface design and then proceed with the editing.</p>
    <p>Product testing is a long-term, even endless process because of rapidly changing technology trends. Our team is not sure that this product will have great success in the market but for now the success in front of us is just that it meets all the requirements in the description. That is also when the testing process ends.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="risk">
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <p>To begin, we have a lot of risks to handle when working as a group, because our members are freshman in our program. Due to our lack of awareness of various instruments that can support us in researching and practicing this issue, technological difficulties are one of the things that we must carefully consider in both software and hardware. Therefore, we will make a list of some of the most important risks in all aspects of our difficulties.</p>
    <p>Lacking expertise about creating an application and designing a website<p>
    <p>We assure that we have to deal with coding-related difficulties on a frequent basis during our development process since we can gain more information in class, but if we want to build a product that we enjoy, we must study more and more on the Internet on our own. Each programming language has a variety of functions that we need to know exactly if we want to use effectively. Therefore, researching on Google and asking the lecturer for assistance with our difficulties are some solutions that we can consider at this time. </p>
    <p>Data loss and corruption<p>
    <p>When we work on the computer, if a computer dies or loses connectivity while uploading data to the server, data loss or corruption may occur unexpectedly. As a viable option, we can write code scripts locally on Atom and frequently submit them to GitHub after each step in order to continue working without considering data loss. Consequently, we will not only be able to reduce data loss as much as possible, but we will also be able to follow each stage of the plan and work together effectively.</p>
    <p>Tool unfamiliarity</p>
    <p>According to us, researching and practicing a new programming language is challenging for certain team members who are used to coding using Pycharm. As a consequence, consulting seniors who have previously utilized this application is a good option when working on this project in order to do this project better to get a higher score.</p>
  <div class="com">
    <h3>Group processes and communication</h3>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, the success of the project depends on the success of many processes. In which, communication is an essential factor linking processes together. Right from the beginning of the project, our team agreed to hold a verbal meeting at least once a week (about 30-45 minutes on Sunday nights). Possibly, every time a serious problem occurs, everyone will convene an urgent meeting to deal with it. However, due to the effects of the epidemic, face-to-face meetings are not feasible, so we are forced to meet from home through technologies such as: Messenger, Teams, Discord. All members are aware that holding meetings saves a lot of time in making decisions and sharing ideas rather than texting. Furthermore, any issues that cannot be resolved through the meeting will be gathered and discussed with the lecturer in the next week's lessons. In addition, during the working process, each member can completely share work progress, difficulties, or just small stories to increase understanding among members on a Facebook chat group. Google Document is also one of the tools my team uses to interact with members. It is very flexible, every time a member changes something, the system records it for others to know.</p>
    <p>Besides the means of communication, the group also agreed on the members' attitudes and behaviors. Thanks to that, we can limit unnecessary conflicts and risks. The main goal of the project should be defined from the beginning to motivate the members. Each member should seriously communicate and responsibly (complete the assigned work before the deadline). Respect the opinions of others, share opinions gently and politely. If a member does not comply or resist, it is the responsibility of other members to explain the consequences and re-distribute his/her work.</p>
